            On a bright sunny day, a group of friends went fishing in the open
            ocean far from any land for an exciting fishing trip. After hours of
            no bites, they noticed the sun was slowly becoming engulfed by large
            and heavy grey clouds. Suddenly the water became very rough and
            choppy. The winds became faster and stronger. Sounds of thunder
            booming and wind whistling took over the atmosphere. The dark sky
            was lit up by lightning. Ferocious waves crashed against the side of
            the boat causing it to flip. In a flash, the group of friends was
            teleported beneath the sea to Squidlantis, the magic kingdom of
            squids. They looked at each other in awe as they were able to
            breathe underwater and realized they were turned into squids, thus
            creating INKredible Squids. They now swim around Squidlantis and
            embark on adventures across the marine metaverse helping other
            marine life along the way.

              Our number one focus is to build an engaging and passionate
              community around our artwork and goals. We will need all of you to
              come together to achieve this! Each squid was created using a
              combination of unique traits hand-drawn by our artist. Damian is a
              talented artist with vast experience in the NFT art space,
              including working with the Wicked Ape Bone Club. This is a wildly
              successful, verified NFT collection with 7.5k in volume traded and
              amazing artwork. 25 ETH will be seeded into the INKredible Squids
              Community Wallet after the minting period is over. This capital
              will be held and controlled by the INKredible Squids DAO (ISD),
              which is further explained in stage 04. Our launch date will be
              announced as soon as the project's quality and technical aspects
              are fully ready.

              holders receiving a significant discount. Hoodies, hats, shirts,
              etc. 50% percent of all profits from merch will go directly into
              the INKredible Squids community wallet! We plan to interact with

              Selling a cheap derivative of our initial collection like other

              community something unique and worth owning. This exclusive
              collection will be revealed shortly after the minting period ends.
              Sneak peeks will be released along the way through our Twitter and
              discord. Rewarding our holders is something we value deeply. To
              accomplish this, we will be offering a 25% discount on the
              additional NFT drop to all INKredible Squids Holders.
              Additionally, holders with 2 or more Squids will be offered a 50%
              discount, and holders with 5 or more squids will receive one FREE
              NFT from our additional drop.

              Because we seek to be a community-funded and focused project,
              after our other stages are completed we plan to restructure the
              INKredible Squids into a decentralized autonomous organization
              (DAO). Thus, creating the INKredible Squids DAO (ISD). This change
              will remove the decision-making power from the creators and place
              it directly into the hands of the INKredible Squids holders. Every
              holder will have a say in our future! Following this decentralized
              structure, all of our holders will also be able to vote on a
              charitable cause to give $15,000 to! More information regarding
              which charities will be selected to be voted on will be released
              in the future. With innovative ideas, adequate resources, and
              proper coordination, we believe that the INKredible Squids DAO has
              no limits as to what it can accomplish!
